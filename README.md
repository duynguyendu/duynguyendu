## Duy Nguyen

Hey ðŸ‘‹! My name is Duy, it's pronounced like "Dewey".

I am based in Wellington, New Zealand. As for moment, I am pursuing Master's in Computer Science. My main interest is in low-level programming such as OS, network and Linux. Outsides of that, I am also interested in deep learning, especially transfomer that powers LLM.

Professionally, I focus on software development in backend, DevOps, and software architecture. I like to build maintainable and scalable software. I believe the most effective way to do so is providing a clear context of why this is here, both in business and technical. This is like having a "conversation" with previous developers and understand their decision process.

Feel free to contact me if you want to talk about software programming philosophy, about the use of AI or just want to have a chat. :)
