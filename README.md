## Duy Nguyen

Hey ðŸ‘‹! My name is Duy! You can pronounced it like "Dewey".

I am based in Wellington, New Zealand. As for moment, I am pursuing Master's in Computer Science, focus mainly on AI, AI's application and programming languages development.
My main interest is in low-level programming such as OS, network and Linux. Outsides of that, I am also interested in deep learning, especially transfomer that powers LLM.

Professionally, I focus on software development in backend, DevOps, and software architecture. I like to build maintainable and scalable software. I believe the most effective way to do so is providing a clear context of why this is here, both in business and technical. This allows others to have a "conversation" with previous developers, understand the decision process and evaluate whether those decisions remain relevant to continue growing the application.

Feel free to contact me if you want to talk about software programming philosophy, about the use of AI or just want to have a chat. :)
